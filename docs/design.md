# USAF PFA Readiness Tracker — Software Design Document

**v1.3 | February 2026 | DRAFT**

Reference: DAFMAN 36-2905 (Change 1, 22 Jan 2026)
Scoring Charts: AFPC 50-20-15-15 Model (23 Sep 2025, provisional)
Timeline: Diagnostic Mar–Jun 2026 | Scored Jul 2026+

## Terminology

This document uses precise language to separate what the member does independently from what the Air Force administers officially.

| Term | Means | Does NOT Mean |
|---|---|---|
| **PFA** | The official, AF-administered fitness evaluation at a FAC or by a UFAC. | Anything this app does. |
| **Self-check** | A member entering their own performance data into this app to estimate where they stand against PFA scoring tables. | An official score. A self-check has no official standing. |
| **Score estimate** | The app's computed output from a self-check. Based on official tables but produced unofficially. | An official PFA score. |
| **Readiness projection** | A forward-looking estimate of where the member's score estimate might land on a future date. | A guarantee. Projections are models, not promises. |
| **D-code** | A short string encoding demographics (DOB + gender). Entered once, reused across self-checks. | A personnel record. |
| **S-code** | A short string encoding a single self-check's raw data. One per self-check. | A score. S-codes contain raw input only. Score estimates are recalculated at decode time. |
| **Component** | One of the four PFA areas: cardio, strength, core, body composition. | An exercise. |
| **Exercise** | A specific movement within a component (e.g., HRPU within strength). | A component. |
| **Exempt** | A component the member is medically excused from via AF Form 469. Contributes 0 earned and 0 possible. | Untested. Exempt is formal medical status. |

## 1. Guardrails (Locked Decisions)

Final. These constrain all downstream design.

| ID | Decision | Rationale | Consequence |
|---|---|---|---|
| GR-01 | 2026+ standards ONLY. No legacy 60-20-20 model. | Forward-looking readiness tool. Old scores? Take a new self-check. | No legacy tables. No standard version selector. No cross-standard import. |
| GR-02 | D-code (demographics) separate from S-code (self-check). | Demographics rarely change. Self-check data changes every session. | Two code types. D-code entered once. S-codes created per session. |
| GR-03 | Each self-check produces its own unique S-code. | Atomic, portable, independently verifiable. | No H-code. History = collection of S-codes entered in a session. |
| GR-04 | D-code contains ONLY: DOB + gender. | DOB needed for age-group derivation at any date. Gender determines bracket. Height/waist are body measurements taken at self-check time. | D-code is maximally compact (~9 chars). Height/waist live in S-code. |
| GR-05 | Member must perform a new self-check to use projections. | Stale/cross-standard projections are misleading. | Projection engine requires 1+ S-codes from 2026 self-checks. |
| GR-06 | No free-text input anywhere. | Complicates encoding, inflates S-code, content moderation. | All feedback is enumerated. No notes. No injury description. No comments. |
| GR-07 | Injury is binary: Yes / No. | Multi-select injury regions add complexity without actionable value. | Single toggle. Yes = "Discuss with your medical provider and UFPM regarding AF Form 469 exemptions." |
| GR-08 | RPE capped at 5 levels. | Borg CR-10 is too granular for a self-check tool. | Enum: EASY / MODERATE / HARD / VERY_HARD / MAXIMAL. 3 bits. |
| GR-09 | Mobile-first. Desktop secondary. | Phone is primary device (gym, track, FAC). | Tailwind mobile-first. Touch targets >= 44px. Bottom-anchored actions. |
| GR-10 | Single-page app. GitHub Pages. Zero backend. | No auth. No database. Static deploy. | State lives in URL params, pasted codes, or session memory. |
| GR-11 | Unofficial tool. Persistent disclaimer. | Not a replacement for official scoring. | Every screen/report: "UNOFFICIAL SELF-CHECK." |
| GR-12 | No PII in codes. | Rank, name, unit entered at report time only. Never encoded. | D-code: DOB + gender. S-code: raw data. Report: PII entered at render, discarded after. |
| GR-13 | Altitude via static base registry, gated by state toggle. | Only 7 USAF installations exceed 5,000 ft. All in CO, WY, or NM. A static enum is simpler, more reliable, and mirrors how the AF will publish correction factors (per-base, not per-coordinate). | No API calls. No lat/long. No coordinates. No seed data. base_id enum in S-code (3 bits). |
| GR-14 | Extensible for future standard changes. | AF has revised timeline once already. Charts are provisional. | Scoring tables versioned. S-codes carry chart_version. Engine = pure function of (version, demographics, raw_data). |
| GR-15 | S-codes do NOT store computed scores. Scores recalculated at decode time. | Chart updates auto-re-score old S-codes. | Score estimate is derived, never persisted. |

## 2. Executive Summary

Single-page, mobile-first web app. USAF Airmen self-check fitness against 2026 PFA scoring tables (50-20-15-15), project readiness toward a future PFA date, generate a supervisor-ready report.

**Zero backend.** D-code entered once. Each self-check produces an S-code. History = collection of S-codes. Sharing via Web Share API and URL hydration.

### Regulatory Context (as of 8 Feb 2026)

Jan 6, 2026 update revised Sep 2025 announcement:

1. 2-mile run no longer mandatory for both semiannual PFAs; HAMR can substitute for both.
2. Diagnostic period: Mar 1 through Jun 30, 2026.
3. Official scored PFAs begin Jul 1, 2026.
4. PFA scores on performance briefs (colonels Feb 2026, LtCol/Maj/CMSgt May 2026).
5. Revised scoring charts "coming soon" but not yet published. Sep 2025 charts are provisional.

### Authorized Exercises (2026 PFA)

Per DAFMAN 36-2905 and Jan 6, 2026 update. All alternate exercises remain available. No exercises added or removed by Jan 2026 update.

| Component | Weight | Exercise Options | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cardio | 50 pts | 2-mile run \| 20m HAMR shuttle run | HAMR can substitute for both semiannual PFAs. 2km walk is profile-only. |
| Strength | 15 pts | 1-min push-ups \| 2-min hand-release push-ups (HRPU) | Member chooses one per PFA. |
| Core | 15 pts | 1-min sit-ups \| 2-min cross-leg reverse crunches (CLRC) \| Forearm plank (max time) | Member chooses one per PFA. |
| Body Comp | 20 pts | Waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) | Universal table (not age/gender-specific). Measured up to 5 days before PFA. |

### Exemption Model (Open Question)

Component exemptions driven by AF Form 469 (medical profile). 2km walk authorized only for members with cardio exemption. When exempt: 0 earned, 0 possible. App allows any exemption combination since member is self-reporting profile status.

**OPEN:** Are there any NEW exemption rules under the 2026 standard, or does AF Form 469 process remain unchanged?

---

## 3. Sharing & URL Hydration

### 3.1 Web Share API (navigator.share)

On mobile (iOS Safari, Chrome Android), native OS share sheet. Member taps Share, picks Messages/AirDrop/email/etc.

- Feature-detect with `navigator.canShare()` before showing Share button.
- Unsupported browsers: fall back to Copy button with confirmation toast.
- Share payload: `{ title: 'PFA Self-Check', text: url }`. Use `text` not `url` to avoid iOS Safari query-parameter stripping.

### 3.2 URL-Based State Hydration

On load, app reads query parameters and hydrates state.

| Param | Value | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `d` | D-code string | Decoded, loaded into demographics. Profile tab auto-populates. |
| `s` | S-code string | Decoded, loaded as self-check. Multiple allowed: `?s=S1-xxx&s=S1-yyy` |
| `tab` | profile \| check \| project \| history \| report | Navigates to tab on load. |

Example: `https://app.example.com/?d=D1-abc123ef&s=S1-xyz789ab&tab=check`

On load: decode D-code, decode S-code(s), navigate to tab. CRC failure on any code = specific error, ignore that param.

### 3.3 Manual Code Entry

Paste field in Profile tab for D-codes. Paste field in History tab for S-codes. Both strip whitespace/newlines, detect prefix mismatches, validate CRC.

---

## 4. Altitude Model

### The List

Only 7 USAF installations exceed 5,000 ft. All in three states.

| base_id | Installation | State | Elevation (ft) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | USAF Academy | CO | 7,258 |
| 2 | Schriever SFB | CO | 6,200 |
| 3 | Cheyenne Mountain SFS | CO | 6,100 |
| 4 | F.E. Warren AFB | WY | 6,065 |
| 5 | Peterson SFB | CO | 6,035 |
| 6 | Buckley SFB | CO | 5,662 |
| 7 | Kirtland AFB | NM | 5,400 |

### UX Flow

1. Toggle: "Are you at a base in CO, WY, or NM?" Default: **No**.
2. **No** → altitude = null, no adjustment, dropdown hidden, nothing stored.
3. **Yes** → dropdown of 7 bases appears. Member picks one. Elevation populates from the constant.
4. S-code stores `base_id` (3 bits, 0-7). 0 = not applicable.

### Extensibility

When AF publishes altitude correction tables, factors will be per-base. The registry mirrors that structure. Adding a base = adding a row to the array.

---

## 5. Validation & Logic Guardrails

### 5.1 Input Validation

| ID | Rule | Enforcement | User Feedback |
|---|---|---|---|
| IV-01 | Self-check date cannot be in the future. | Date picker max = today. | Greyed out future dates. |
| IV-02 | Target PFA date must be after most recent self-check date. | Validation on entry. | "Target date must be after your last self-check." |
| IV-03 | Target PFA date cannot exceed 365 days out. | Validation on entry. | "Target dates beyond 1 year produce unreliable projections." |
| IV-04 | DOB must produce age 17-65 at self-check date. | Validation on decode/entry. | "Age at self-check date is outside USAF service range." |
| IV-05 | Height: 48-84 inches. | Input clamp. | Out-of-range rejected. |
| IV-06 | Waist: 20.0-55.0 inches. | Input clamp. | Out-of-range rejected. |
| IV-07 | Run/walk time: > 0:00 and <= 2:00:00. | Validation. Accepts mm:ss or h:mm:ss. | "Enter a valid time between 0:01 and 2:00:00." |
| IV-08 | Reps cannot be negative. | Input min=0. | Spinner enforces floor of 0. |
| IV-09 | Plank time <= 10:00 (600 seconds). | Input clamp. | "Maximum plank entry is 10 minutes." |
| IV-10 | At least one component must be non-exempt. | Validation on calculation. | "All components exempt. No composite score possible." |
| IV-11 | Walk option only visible when cardio exemption ON. | UI enforces. | Walk hidden for non-profiled members. |
| IV-12 | HAMR: whole numbers (shuttles) OR time (mm:ss). Presence of `:` triggers time-to-shuttle conversion (hidden feature). | Input parsing. | No UI indication of time mode. Just works. |
| IV-13 | Height required alongside waist for WHtR. | Both required if non-exempt. | "Enter both height and waist for body composition scoring." |

> **HAMR Time-to-Shuttle (Hidden Feature):** If input contains `:` (e.g., "12:30"), silently convert to shuttle count via HAMR timing table. Round down to last completed shuttle. Undocumented. Member enters what they know.

### 5.2 Scoring Logic

| ID | Rule | Why |
|---|---|---|
| SL-01 | Reps/time at or above chart max → max points. Never 0. | Known bug in other apps: exceeding max falls through table. |
| SL-02 | Reps/time at or below chart min → min row points (unless truly 0 reps). | 0 is the only value below chart minimum. |
| SL-03 | Run time boundary: listed time is the SLOWEST time for that point value. | Off-by-one flips pass/fail. |
| SL-04 | HAMR ranges that skip shuttle counts: inclusive brackets. | 94 shuttles falls into 92-96. No interpolation. |
| SL-05 | WHtR = waist / height, rounded to 2 decimals (standard rounding) before lookup. | 0.495 → 0.50. |
| SL-06 | Composite = (earned / possible) x 100, rounded to 1 decimal. | Must match official rounding. |
| SL-07 | Walk: 0 earned, 0 possible for cardio. Composite from remaining components. | Walk completers scored as if cardio exempt. |
| SL-08 | Component pass/fail independent of composite. Check BOTH. | 80+ composite still fails if any component below minimum. |
| SL-09 | All components exempt = exempt. No score. No composite. "Fully exempt per AF Form 469." | Not 0. Not N/A. Exempt. |
| SL-10 | 0 reps on non-exempt component = chart lowest value AND component minimum failure. | Tested-and-scored-zero is not exempt. |

### 5.3 Projection

| ID | Rule | Why |
|---|---|---|
| PG-01 | Projections clamped to scoring table bounds. | Linear can project negative times or 200 push-ups. |
| PG-02 | Log model falls back to linear with 1 data point. | Log fitting needs 2+. |
| PG-03 | Historical trend requires 3+ self-checks. Below that, disabled. | "Need 3+ self-checks for historical trend analysis." |
| PG-04 | Age group for projection uses DOB + target_pfa_date. | Member aging into new bracket gets different standards. |
| PG-05 | Cannot project improvement on exempt component. | No data to project from. |
| PG-06 | Member can flag S-code as outlier to exclude from trend. | Bad days skew fit. |
| PG-07 | Output includes days remaining + required weekly improvement for each failing component. | Actionable, not just pass/fail. |
| PG-08 | Amber warning when projected composite within 3 pts of 75.0. | "Margin is thin." |

### 5.4 Code Strings

| ID | Rule | Why |
|---|---|---|
| CS-01 | D-code prefix: `D1-`. S-code prefix: `S1-`. Digit = schema version. | Self-identifying. Version enables schema evolution. |
| CS-02 | CRC-8 appended to every code. | Catches truncation/corruption. |
| CS-03 | Decode failure = specific error. Never silent wrong data. | "Invalid code: checksum mismatch." |
| CS-04 | D-code: schema version + DOB + gender. | No height. No PII. Maximally compact. |
| CS-05 | S-code: schema version + chart version + date + height + waist + components + feedback + base_id. | Height/waist are body measurements, not demographics. |
| CS-06 | S-codes do NOT contain computed scores. | Recalculated at decode time (GR-15). |
| CS-07 | Base64url (RFC 4648 section 5). No padding. | URL-safe. |
| CS-08 | D-code in S-code field → specific error. | Prefix detection. |
| CS-09 | Future schema version → "Code from newer version. Please update the app." | Forward compat. |

### 5.5 UX

| ID | Rule | Why |
|---|---|---|
| UX-01 | Live score estimate banner. No "calculate" button. | Immediate feedback. |
| UX-02 | Component pass/fail badges (green/red) alongside points. | Must see both. |
| UX-03 | Exercise type = segmented control, not dropdown. | One-tap vs two-tap. |
| UX-04 | Exemption toggle = separate switch per component. | Exempt is status, not exercise. |
| UX-05 | Walk only appears when cardio exemption ON. | Profile-only. |
| UX-06 | All exempt = clear message, not score of 0. | "Fully exempt. No score estimate possible." |
| UX-07 | Report tab blocked until 1+ self-checks scored. | No empty reports. |
| UX-08 | Code display: Copy button + Share button (Web Share API). | Copy for desktop. Share for mobile. |
| UX-09 | Code paste field strips whitespace/newlines. | Notes apps add breaks. |
| UX-10 | Diagnostic period auto-detected from self-check date. | No manual checkbox. |
| UX-11 | Time inputs accept mm:ss and total seconds. Display always mm:ss. | Some think in seconds, others mm:ss. |
| UX-12 | Injury = Yes → guidance text. | Directive, not diagnostic. |
| UX-13 | Altitude: state toggle → base dropdown. | Simple. Gated. 7 options. |

### 5.6 Report

| ID | Rule | Why |
|---|---|---|
| RP-01 | Rank/name/unit at report time. Never stored. Never encoded. | PII protection. |
| RP-02 | Report includes D-code and S-code(s) used. | Independent verification. |
| RP-03 | Watermark: "UNOFFICIAL SELF-CHECK." | Prevents misuse. |
| RP-04 | Includes scoring chart version. | Traceability. |
| RP-05 | Diagnostic period dates: "DIAGNOSTIC PERIOD (non-scored)." | Prevents confusion. |
| RP-06 | Output: clipboard (plain text) + print-optimized HTML. | Email/Teams + hardcopy. |
| RP-07 | Footer: "Prepared by member for supervisory awareness." | Sets expectation. |
| RP-08 | Projection section optional (toggled). | Some want current status only. |

## 6. Edge Cases

| ID | Edge Case | Expected Behavior | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| EC-01 | Reps exceed chart max | Clamp to max points. Never 0. | CRITICAL |
| EC-02 | Age group rollover between self-check and target PFA date | Projection uses DOB + target date. Self-check uses DOB + self-check date. | CRITICAL |

## 8. Scoring Engine

### Table Structure

Single active standard (v2025_sep, provisional).

```
TABLES[chartVersion][gender][ageGroup][exercise] = Array<{ threshold, points }>
```

- Sorted by threshold (descending for reps/shuttles, ascending for times).
- WHtR: single shared array (universal).
- Walk time limits: gender + age group (pass/fail only).
- Minimums: `MINIMUMS[chartVersion][gender][ageGroup][exercise] = value`.
- `chartVersion` key enables future swaps without touching engine.

### Composite Calculation

```
points_earned   = sum(each tested component's looked-up points)
points_possible = sum(each tested component's max weight)
composite       = round((earned / possible) * 100, 1)
pass            = composite >= 75.0 AND every_tested_component >= its_minimum
```

Component weights: Cardio 50 | WHtR 20 | Strength 15 | Core 15 | Total 100

---

## 9. Projection Engine

### Models

**Linear (1+ self-checks):** daily_rate = (target - current) / days. Clamped to chart bounds.

**Logarithmic (2+ self-checks):** projected = current + k * ln(1 + days / tau). Diminishing returns. Falls back to linear with 1 point.

**Historical Trend (3+ self-checks):** Least-squares on non-outlier S-codes. Linear or quadratic by R-squared. Confidence band widens with extrapolation. Disabled below 3.

### Per-Component Output

- Projected raw value at target PFA date
- Projected points (scored against target-date age bracket)
- Pass/fail against minimum
- Gap to minimum (positive = surplus, negative = deficit)
- Required weekly improvement (if failing)
- Confidence: HIGH (3+, good fit) / MEDIUM (2) / LOW (1, linear fallback)

---

## 10. UI Architecture

### Tab Structure

| Tab | Label | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Profile | D-code entry/display. DOB picker, gender toggle. Copy + Share. Paste field. |
| 2 | Self-Check | Exercise selectors (segmented), value inputs, exemption toggles, height, waist, altitude toggle/dropdown. Live score banner. S-code output with Copy + Share. |
| 3 | Project | Target PFA date, model selector, per-component gap bars, projected composite, amber warning. |
| 4 | History | S-code paste, decoded list, outlier flag, trend mini-chart. |
| 5 | Report | Rank/name/unit (not stored), feedback review, projection toggle, Copy + Print. |

### Feedback (Structured Only)

| Field | Type | Values | Bits |
|---|---|---|---|
| RPE | Enum (5) | Easy / Moderate / Hard / Very Hard / Maximal | 3 |
| Sleep | Enum (4) | Poor / Fair / Good / Excellent | 2 |
| Nutrition | Enum (4) | Fasted / Light / Normal / Heavy | 2 |
| Injured | Bool | No / Yes → guidance text | 1 |
| Environment | Bitmask (6) | Hot, Cold, Humid, Windy, Altitude Notable, Indoor | 6 |
| Confidence | Enum (5) | Not Ready / Uncertain / Neutral / Confident / Very Confident | 3 |

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | React (Vite SPA) | Components, hooks, fast HMR |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v3+ | Mobile-first, small bundle |
| Icons | Heroicons (React) | SVG, tree-shakeable |
| Charts | Recharts | React-native, responsive |
| Sharing | Web Share API + URL params | Native mobile + URL hydration |
| Hosting | GitHub Pages | Free, static, CI/CD |

---

## 11. Risk Register

| Risk | Prob | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scoring charts revised before Jul 2026 | HIGH | HIGH | chart_version in S-code. Swappable module. Ship with Sep 2025. |
| Altitude adjustments never published for 2-mile | MED | MED | Ship without. Warning: "Official adjustments pending." |
| DoW mandate imposes gender-neutral minimums | MED | HIGH | Monitor. Modular brackets. |
| App mistaken for official scoring | MED | HIGH | Non-dismissible banner. Watermark. Footer. |
| iOS Safari strips URL query params via Web Share | MED | MED | Use `text` not `url` in navigator.share(). Trailing space workaround. |
| Walk time limits changed under new standard | MED | MED | Flag as provisional. Verify when DAFMAN publishes. |
| S-codes corrupted by messaging platform link preview | LOW | MED | Base64url. CRC catches corruption. |

---

## 12. Implementation Phases

| Phase | Deliverable | Depends On |
|---|---|---|
| P1: Scoring Engine | Pure function: (chartVersion, gender, dob, date, exercise, raw) → { points, pass, category }. All 18 brackets. WHtR. Walk. Minimums. Prorated. Unit tests for every edge case. | Verified AFPC scoring data. |
| P2: Code Codec | D-code / S-code encode/decode. Bit-packing. CRC-8. Base64url. Prefix detection. All error messages. | P1 data model. |
