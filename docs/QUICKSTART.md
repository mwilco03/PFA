## Step 3: What Just Happened?

You now have:
- **D-code** (demographics) = your age/gender
- **S-code** (self-check) = your workout data

Your **score estimate** shows at the top. This is NOT an official score, just an estimate.

## That's It!

Next time you work out, repeat Step 2. Save each S-code.

## What About the Other Tabs?

**History** - Paste all your S-codes here to see trends

**Project** - Enter your next PFA date, see if you're on track to pass

**Report** - Generate a formatted report for your supervisor

## What if I Have a Medical Profile?

If you have an AF Form 469 exempting you from a component:
1. In Self-Check, toggle the **Exempt** switch for that component
2. Don't enter data for that component
3. Your score will calculate from the remaining components

## What if I'm at High Altitude?

Only matters if you're at one of these bases:
- USAF Academy
- Schriever SFB
- Cheyenne Mountain SFS
- F.E. Warren AFB
- Peterson SFB
- Buckley SFB
- Kirtland AFB

If you are:
1. Toggle "Are you at a base in CO, WY, or NM?"
2. Select your base from the dropdown

## Common Questions

**Q: Where is my data stored?**
A: Only in your browser. No server. No cloud. Just your device.

**Q: What if I lose my codes?**
A: You lose your data. Save them in Notes, iCloud, or wherever you keep important stuff.

**Q: Can I use this on multiple devices?**
A: Yes. Just paste your codes into the app on the new device.

**Q: Is this an official Air Force app?**
A: NO. This is unofficial. Always defer to your UFPM and DAFMAN 36-2905.

**Q: Will this score match my official PFA?**
A: Probably close, but maybe not exactly. Official scores come from FACs only.
