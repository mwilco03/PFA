## Training Principles (All Components)

1. **Progressive Overload**: Gradually increase intensity/volume
2. **Specificity**: Train movements you'll be tested on
3. **Recovery**: Rest days prevent overtraining
4. **Consistency**: 3-5 workouts/week more important than intensity
5. **Form Over Reps**: Perfect technique prevents injury
6. **Test Simulation**: Practice full PFA conditions monthly
7. **Diminishing Returns**: Going from 80% to 90% requires exponentially more effort than 60% to 80%

## Exemption Considerations

**If component is exempt (AF Form 469):**
- ❌ Do NOT recommend exercises for exempt component
- ✅ Focus training on non-exempt components
- ✅ Consult UFPM and medical provider before any training changes
- ✅ Consider low-impact alternatives if injury-related exemption

**Example: Cardio Exemption**
- Don't suggest: Running, sprints, HAMR training
- Do suggest: Focus on strength and core excellence
- Note: 2km walk available if profile permits

## Implementation in App

**Recommendation Selection Logic:**
```
1. Calculate component score percentage
2. Determine tier (< 75%, 75-80%, > 80%)
3. Check exemption status
4. Select 2-3 relevant recommendations from tier
5. Display with "🎯" icon for current focus
```

**Example Output:**
```
Cardio (2-mile run): 68.5% - BELOW PASSING
💪 Improvement Tips:
• Walk-Run Intervals: 2 min run / 1 min walk × 10
• Focus on breathing: 3-step inhale, 2-step exhale
• Add 1 long slow run (3-5 miles) per week

Strength (Push-ups): 82.3% - STRONG PASS
🚀 Excel Further:
• Try decline push-ups (feet elevated)
• Add explosive push-ups to build power
• Challenge: 200 push-ups in one day
```
